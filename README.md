# Hangman Game
## In this project, players are presented with a secret word or phrase, represented by a series of blank spaces, and must guess the correct letters one by one. The objective is to guess the word before running out of attempts, with each incorrect guess resulting in a step-by-step drawing of a "hangman."

### Key Features:
- Word Database: The Hangman Game project will include a substantial word database from which random animal names. This ensures a diverse and challenging gaming experience.

- Word Display: The secret word or phrase is initially displayed as blank spaces, with revealed letters filling in as they are guessed correctly.

- Game Logic: The project will implement the game's core logic, including tracking the player's guesses, and updating the hangman's drawing.

- Winning and Losing Conditions: The game will determine when the player has won by correctly guessing the word or phrase and when they have lost by allowing the hangman to be fully drawn. It will then display an appropriate message to the player.

** Programming Language**: Python
** Data Storage**: Text files or lists for word database
** Game Logic**: Python functions and data structures

### Project Goals:
The primary goal of the Hangman Game project is to create an engaging and functional implementation of the classic word-guessing game. It aims to challenge players' word recognition and deduction skills while providing an enjoyable gaming experience. Additionally, the project can serve as a valuable exercise for those learning Python programming, as it involves working with strings, loops, conditional statements, and user input.

### Potential Extensions:

To enhance the project, you can consider adding features such as a graphical hangman display, sound effects, and multiplayer options. Additionally, you can expand the word database to include themed categories or allow players to input their own words and phrases.
